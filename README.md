This repository is a compilation of projects made during the Python Ghana PyData Six weeks Intensive Data Science Training.
Currently the projects in the repo are:
1. A jupyter notebook with scripts that scraps data from indeed.com. The data includes remote data science jobs available on the site (www.indeed.com)
2. A jupyter notebook with scripts that scraps laptops and their prices on www.jumia.com.gh. 

The data gotten from these projects are stored in their various csv files.

NOTE: This repo is little bit messy. This was done by a begginer (me. lol). I will work on it later.
